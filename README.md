# CRUD API with Hono and Supabase

This project is a backend server built with [Hono](https://hono.dev/), a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for the Edge. It provides a CRUD API for managing "courses" and "students". The course data is persisted in a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) database, while the student data is currently mocked from a JSON file.

## Features

-   **Fast and Lightweight:** Built on top of Hono.
-   **TypeScript:** Fully written in TypeScript for type safety.
-   **Database Integration:** Uses Supabase for database operations for courses.
-   **Validation:** Uses [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for request validation.
-   **Environment-based Configuration:** Uses `.env` files for easy configuration.
-   **Health Check:** Includes a `/health` endpoint to monitor service status.

## Technologies Used

-   [Hono](https://hono.dev/) - Web framework
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Language
-   [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - Database and backend services
-   [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - Validation
-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - JavaScript runtime and toolkit (implied by `bun.lock`)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) installed on your machine.
-   A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account and a project set up.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Prostecki/hono-app.git
    cd hono-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and add your Supabase credentials:
    ```
    HONO_PORT=3000
    SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_url"
    SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_supabase_anon_key"
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
`bun run dev`
```

The server will start on the port specified in your `.env` file (default is `3000`).

## API Endpoints

### Health Check

-   `GET /health`: Checks the health of the service and returns uptime information.

### Courses API (`/courses`)

-   `GET /`: Get all courses.
-   `GET /:id`: Get a single course by its ID.
-   `POST /`: Create a new course.
-   `PUT /:id`: Update an existing course.
-   `DELETE /:id`: Delete a course.

### Students API (`/students`)

-   `GET /`: Get all students (from JSON file).
-   `GET /:id`: Get a single student by ID (from JSON file).
-   `POST /`: (Mock) Validates and returns the created student data without saving.
-   `PUT /:id`: (Mock) Validates and returns the updated student data without saving.
-   `DELETE /:id`: (Mock) Returns the found student data without deleting.
